## Asking the Right Questions

Uncertainty can feel endless when every question seems equally urgent.  
But now you know better:  

- **Urgent unknowns** help you focus on what matters most right now.  
- **Hypotheses** give those unknowns a testable shape.  
- **Exploration** keeps you honest when the frame itself is fuzzy, surfacing surprises that force you to rethink.  

Together, these tools form a cycle:  

1. Notice what you don’t know.  
2. Shape it into a hypothesis you can test.  
3. Wander into the world when you don’t yet know what to test.  
4. Let surprises reshape your frame.

That’s how entrepreneurs turn fog into clarity — not by guessing, but by asking better questions.  


## Looking Ahead  

Part III takes the next step.  
Once you’ve framed the right questions, you need ways to **gather and use evidence**.  
We’ll shift from questions into methods: testing, measuring, and interpreting what you find.  

This is where the rubber meets the road. You’ll see how evidence sharpens judgment, when to trust your data, and how to act on what you learn.  

Because in the end, good questions are only powerful if they lead you to better answers.
