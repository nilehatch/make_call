# Make the Call: Knowing What You Know, Learning What You Can, and Acting Under Uncertainty in Entrepreneurship

This is the working book project for **_Make the Call_** — a practical guide for entrepreneurs who want to build knowledge, sharpen judgment, and make smart decisions under uncertainty.

## What This Book Covers

- Why uncertainty is the entrepreneur’s starting point — not a bug
- How to think like a knowledge-seeker (not just a guesser)
- Epistemologies for entrepreneurs: rationalism, empiricism, pragmatism, testimony, and faith

- How to ask better questions, design smarter experiments, and judge evidence wisely
- The spiritual and intellectual growth of the decision-maker
