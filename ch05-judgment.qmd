# Believing and Acting Before You Know {#sec-believing-acting}

You know the feeling when you start something new?

The clock is ticking. The numbers aren’t all there. Your gut says yes, but your head keeps throwing up questions. And yet, the lease needs signing, the product needs shipping, or the investor needs an answer.

This is the paradox of entrepreneurship: you need knowledge to act, but often you only get knowledge *after* you act.

## The Illusion of “Enough” Knowledge

Some entrepreneurs wait for perfect clarity. They convince themselves that one more survey, one more advisor, one more test will finally settle the fog.

But certainty never fully arrives. You can learn a lot, yes. You can reduce uncertainty. But you can’t erase it. There will always be unknowns that data can’t touch — future shocks, customer quirks, timing quirks, the sheer unpredictability of people and markets.

The danger is paralysis. Waiting for certainty is often just a way of avoiding responsibility. By the time the picture is perfectly clear, the opportunity is usually gone.


## Example: The Two Bridges

Picture two founders staring across a canyon.

- **Founder A** says, “We can’t step out until the bridge is fully built. We’ll keep testing, surveying, and waiting until every plank is nailed down.” By the time they’re satisfied, others have already crossed.
- **Founder B** says, “We’ve tested enough. The first planks look solid. We’ll learn as we go.” They step forward, building the bridge under their feet. To outsiders it looks reckless. From the inside, it’s a calculated act of judgment — a willingness to risk, to learn, and to keep moving before certainty arrives.

Most entrepreneurial breakthroughs look reckless to those on the sidelines. To those making the call, they are acts of judgment, calibrated by knowledge *and* courage.


## Acting on Judgment, Not Certainty

So what’s the alternative to paralysis or recklessness?

Judgment.

Judgment is the entrepreneur’s superpower — the ability to act without full clarity, using the strongest mix of belief, justification, and evidence you’ve assembled so far.^[Nicolai Foss and Peter Klein [-@foss2012organizing] developed a formal definition of judgment as decision-making under uncertainty that cannot be modeled or parameterized as a set of formal decision rules. Judgment is midway between the “rational decision-making” of neoclassical economics models and blind luck or random guessing. We sometimes call it intuition, gut feeling, or understanding.]

Judgment is not guessing. Guessing ignores evidence. Judgment weighs what you know, what you believe, and what you can reasonably assume — then acts, knowing some uncertainty will always remain.

### Judgment
The act of making a decision under uncertainty when evidence is incomplete.\
Judgment is conviction tested against the best evidence you have — and still strong enough to compel action.

## A Simple Loop For Practicing Judgment 

1. **Frame the decision.** What exactly are you choosing? Narrow it.  
2. **Assemble what’s known.** Gather the facts, data, and convictions you already hold.  
3. **Identify the gaps.** Name what’s unknown. Ask: is it learnable quickly, or irreducible?  
4. **Set a threshold.** Decide how much clarity is “enough” to move forward.  
5. **Make the call.** Act, knowing you’ll learn more after action than before.  
6. **Review & revise.** Reflect on outcomes so your judgment grows sharper over time.  

Judgment’s strength is speed: it keeps you moving when others stall.
Its weakness is fallibility: conviction doesn’t guarantee correctness.
The fix is reflection — treating each act of judgment as training data for the next call.


## Reflection

- Think of a time you acted with incomplete knowledge. How did it feel?
- When do you lean too hard on data? When do you lean too much on conviction?
- What’s one decision in your venture right now that requires judgment rather than waiting?


## Try This: The Judgment Call

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Take a decision you’re stalling on.

1. **Write down what you know.** Facts, data, observations, evidence.
2. **Write down what you believe.** Convictions, intuitions, faith.
3. **Ask yourself:** What more could I realistically learn in the next week?
4. **Decide:** Is this enough to act, or is there one critical unknown worth waiting for?

By the end, you’ll have either the courage to move forward, or a clear plan for what to learn before you do. Both are progress.
