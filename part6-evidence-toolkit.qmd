# Evidence Toolkit {#part-toolkit}

#### How-To Guides for Finding and Using Data to Make Smart Decisions under Uncertainty {.subtitle}


## Why This Toolkit Exists  

The narrative chapters in [Part III](part3-gather-evidence.qmd) showed you the big picture:  

- Why evidence matters.  
- Where it comes from.  
- How to avoid common traps.  

But when you actually sit down to *gather evidence*, principles aren’t enough. You need **clickable links, fast tracks, and concrete examples.** That’s what this Toolkit is for.  

Think of it as a **companion manual** — not required reading, but a place you can dip into whenever you need practical steps.

## How to Use This Toolkit  
- **By Source.** Each Toolkit chapter matches one narrative chapter (Public, Private, Customer, Experts, Modeling, Accounting).  
- **By Need.** Start with your question: *What do I need to know right now?* Then jump to the matching section.  
- **By Entry.** Each source follows the same format:  
    - Quick Reference (what it is, link, best use, limits) 
    - Fast Track (3–4 steps to use it today)  
    - Entrepreneur’s Use Case (how someone actually applied it)  
    - Pro Tip (shortcut, hack, or watch-out)
