# E2. Private Data Toolkit {#sec-private-data-toolkit-chapter .unnumbered}

Private data isn’t “hidden” so much as **behind doors**: library logins, paid subscriptions, and vendor portals. The payoff is depth — ratios, panels, deal flow, and category reports that go far beyond Google.

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
**License note (read me):** Most HBLL databases are **for educational use only**. Do not use for consulting, freelancing, or outside employment. When in doubt, ask a librarian and **summarize** instead of redistributing proprietary PDFs.
:::

Think in **pairs** as you gather evidence:

1. **Industry & Finance** — structure + money reality  
2. **Markets & Consumers** — attitudes + behavior  
3. **Demographics & Society** — people + place over time  
4. **Deals & Competitors** — capital flows + rivals’ moves  


## 1. Industry & Finance

You’re deciding *how the game works* and *what “normal” looks like in dollars*. Use industry sources for structure and size; finance sources for ratios, quartiles, and money facts.

### BizMiner  
[Use BizMiner (BYU access)](https://app.bizminer.com/search)

**Good For:** Industry financial profiles, failure rates, local vs. national benchmarks.  
**Not Great For:** Narrative reports or consumer insight.

#### Fast Track
1. Search by NAICS and geography.  
2. Open **Financial Profiles** for margins and costs; **Market Profiles** for counts and growth.  
3. Export the ratio table (quartiles) and translate into **unit economics**.

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
*A furniture maker scouting a second plant saw one county had **2× more wood suppliers** within 50 miles. Lower transport costs tipped the decision.*

#### Pro Tip
Use **quartiles**, not single points. Your early ops won’t hit “median.”

[Use Mergent KBR (BYU access)](https://www.mergentkbr.com/)

**Good For:** 14 core ratios across 800+ industries with quartiles.

2. Pull 3-year ratio sets (upper/median/lower).  
3. Map to your **COGS, SG&A, inventory turns, coverage**.

3. Grab **Cost Structure** to stress-test your assumptions.

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
*An HVAC contractor saw IBISWorld flag **labor constraints** as the #1 risk and prioritized technician recruiting ahead of demand spikes.*

#### Pro Tip
Pair IBISWorld’s **forest view** with BizMiner/KBR’s **trees**.

### S&P Capital IQ (advanced)  
[Use CapIQ (BYU access; limited seats)](https://lib.byu.edu/)

## Common Pitfalls (and Fixes)

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Pitfall:** **License & “educational use only.”**  
**Fix:** Check terms before exporting, sharing, or using outside class. Summarize insights; don’t redistribute PDFs.
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Pitfall:** **Apples vs. oranges** across sources.  
**Fix:** Align **definitions** (NAICS/SIC, geo, channel, time window) before comparing.
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Pitfall:** **False certainty** from polished charts.  
**Fix:** Convert to **decisions**: ratios → unit economics; category size → beachhead; comps → raise & milestones.

## BYU Access Tips (Quick)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
- Start at the **HBLL database page** so licenses are recognized.  
- Many tools require **account creation** with BYU email; some have **limited seats** (CapIQ, ProQuest TDM).  
- When sources cite others (e.g., Statista → OECD), follow the trail — the **original** is often free and deeper.

## Entrepreneur’s Checklist: Using Private Data

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
1. **Frame the decision.** What choice will this change?  
2. **Pick the pair.** Industry & Finance, Markets & Consumers, Demographics & Society, or Deals & Competitors.  
3. **Grab one per side.** Enough to get **ranges**, not false precision.  
4. **Note license limits.** Educational vs. commercial; cite responsibly.  
5. **Translate to action.** Price, channel, feature cut, investor list.  
6. **Log assumptions.** What would make you revisit?

## A Final Word

This Toolkit is a **doorway**, not a destination. Use it when you need sharper numbers or faster falsification — then get back to building.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Trap to Avoid: Free ≠ Easy; Paid ≠ Truth.**  
Private data can be deep and shiny. Treat it as **evidence to decide**, not decoration for slides. Pair it with fresh signals and your own tests.
