# Public Data

## Free Gold in Plain Sight

Before you spend a dime on consultants or surveys, check what’s already out there.  
Governments, universities, nonprofits, and even companies themselves publish mountains of data that anyone can use. Most entrepreneurs ignore it. That’s a mistake.  

Public data won’t answer every question. It can be old, messy, or too broad. But it can also save you weeks of guessing. It’s like a free radar screen: you may not see every detail, but you can spot where the big signals are coming from.  

## What Counts as Public Data?

Public data isn’t just “government statistics.” It includes:  

- **Government sources** like census data, import/export records, and labor statistics.  
- **Nonprofits and universities** that release research reports and surveys.  
- **Open datasets** on platforms like World Bank, Kaggle, or UN databases.  
- **Web evidence** hiding in plain sight: reviews, ratings, Google Trends, and social media chatter.

**Definition:** *Public Data* is evidence you can legally access for free (or at minimal cost) without special permission.

## Why It Matters

When you’re starting out, money is tight and time is tighter. Public data gives you breadth you could never collect on your own. You can:  

- Size markets before committing.  
- Spot rising trends before they hit the news.  
- Rule out bad ideas quickly without burning cash.  

The smartest entrepreneurs I know don’t start with a blank slate — they start with the free maps that are already drawn.  

## Where to Find Public Data

There’s no single door to public data — but there are a few main hallways you can always check first.

- [**World Bank Open Data**](https://data.worldbank.org) — Global indicators like GDP, inflation, and trade. Good for testing international market feasibility.  
- [**Our World in Data**](https://ourworldindata.org) — Clean visual datasets on health, energy, environment, and global trends.

## Common Traps in Public Data

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal" icon="alert-triangle"}
## Trap to Avoid: Outdated Numbers

Many public datasets lag months or years behind reality.  
A “2022” report might not reflect post-pandemic shifts or new competitors.  
Always check the date before betting on the trend.

## Trap to Avoid: Broad Averages

Census data can tell you the *average household income* in a region.  
That doesn’t mean your niche target — say, college students or retirees — will behave like that average.  
Public data is wide, not always deep.

### Boost: Cross-Check Timeliness

Pair older public data with fresher signals — news articles, Google Trends, or even a handful of quick customer interviews.  
The combination gives you both scale and recency.

### Boost: Use Public Data to Eliminate

You don’t need perfect data to make progress.  
If census numbers show a shrinking population in your target city, you can rule it out and move on.  
Public data is great for narrowing the field.

## Mini-Case

When Jasmine launched her first food truck, she didn’t guess where to park.  
She pulled public health inspection data from her city’s open-data portal and noticed that one neighborhood had dozens of restaurants but also the highest rate of recent closures.  
That told her two things: strong demand and space for new players.  
Her truck sold out almost every day in the first month — thanks to data anyone could have checked.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="tools"}
### Quick Steps

1. [ ] **Start with your question.** What decision are you trying to make — market size, location, trend spotting?  
2. [ ] **Pick one or two sources.**  Check a government portal, an open-data site, or a web-based signal. Don’t drown in datasets.  
3. [ ] **Check the basics.**  Look at the date, scope, and definitions. Ask: “Does this match my customer?”  
4. [ ] **Cross-check.**  Pair the public dataset with a fresher or narrower signal (interviews, trends, competitor scans).  
5. [ ] **Decide and move.**  Use public data to rule out bad ideas or point you toward better ones. Don’t wait for perfection.
