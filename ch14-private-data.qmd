## The Good Stuff Behind the Paywall

Some of the most useful evidence you’ll ever touch isn’t on Google.  
It lives behind library logins, paid subscriptions, or vendor portals.  

This **private data** is often cleaner, deeper, and closer to the money: real financials, industry ratios, consumer panels, deal flow, and global category reports. Used well, it can help you decide in hours what would otherwise take weeks.

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal" icon="info"}
**Definition:** *Private data* is evidence you access through a license, subscription, or permission (e.g., university library databases, paid research, vendor APIs).  

*Use terms vary — many academic licenses allow* **educational use only** *(no consulting or commercial projects). Always check your license.*

## Why It Matters

Private data can give you:

- **Signal with teeth:** Benchmarks, ratios, and financials that tie to actual performance.  
- **Category clarity:** What’s growing, who’s leading, how the game is played.  
- **Faster falsification:** Kill weak ideas quickly; focus your next test on live options.

But it comes with responsibility: respect licenses, cite carefully, and don’t confuse polished charts with truth. Use it to **decide**, not decorate.


## Four Kinds of Private Data (and When to Use Them)

Think in **pairs**: each type bundles two complementary lenses.  
Pick the pair that matches the decision you’re making now.

---

### 1. Industry & Finance  
*“How do firms like mine actually perform?”*

Use **industry** data to understand the game’s structure (margins, failure rates, local vs. national differences).  
Use **finance** to ground yourself in money facts (ratios, unit economics, quartiles).

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="map"}
**Starter map (examples):** Industry ratio books & portals, benchmark compendia, firm-level financial databases, local vs. national industry profiles.  
**Questions it answers:**  

- What margins do typical operators earn?  
- What’s normal for inventory turns, CAC payback, or debt coverage?  
- How do my assumptions compare to upper/middle/lower quartiles?
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal" icon="alert-triangle"}
**Trap:** **False precision.** Ratios are averages across messy firms. Use **ranges** (quartiles), not single numbers. Local context can shift everything.
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal" icon="lightbulb"}
**Mini-Case — The Laundry vs. Car Wash Choice**  
Two friends want a cash-flow business.  
Industry reports show laundries with lower capex and steady margins; car washes show higher margins **but** high leverage and weather volatility.  
They model both using **quartile** ratios and local lease comps.  
Decision: start with a small, de-risked laundry; revisit car wash after building operator muscle.  
**Lesson:** Pair structure (industry) with money reality (finance) to right-size ambition.
:::

### 2. Consumer & Behavior  
*“Who are these people, and what do they actually do?”*

Use **consumer** panels and surveys to segment attitudes, media habits, and purchase intent.  
Use **behavior** logs to see what people actually do (not just say).

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="map"}
**Starter map (examples):** Large consumer survey panels, psychographic segmentations, longitudinal social surveys, media usage datasets.  
**Questions it answers:**  

- Who buys, why, and through which channels?  
- Which attitudes correlate with trial vs. repeat?  
- Is my target reachable through the media they actually consume?
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal" icon="alert-triangle"}
**Trap:** **Self-report bias.** Stated intent ≠ behavior. Treat surveys as **hypothesis fuel**, and validate with behavioral data or small purchase tests.
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal" icon="lightbulb"}
**Mini-Case — The “Clean Energy” Teens**  
A hardware startup wants to market a home energy device to eco-conscious teens.  
Consumer panels show teens express high concern — but spending power and decision authority sit with parents.  
Behavioral data: parents respond to **bill savings**; teens engage on social but don’t convert.  
Pivot: message to parents (savings) and empower teens as advocates (referrals).  
**Lesson:** Segment by **payer** and **user**; match message to who decides.
:::

### 3. Product & Market Signals  
*“Where is the category moving, and what’s next?”*

Use **product** research to learn feature sets, attribute trade-offs, and adoption curves.  
Use **market** outlooks to see macro demand, regulation, and competitive positioning.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="map"}
**Starter map (examples):** Category deep-dives, trend reports, technology landscapes, channel forecasts, expert quadrants/scapes.  
**Questions it answers:**  

- Which features are table-stakes vs. differentiators?  
- What’s growing, where, and through which channels?  
- Who’s leading, fast-following, or fading?
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal" icon="alert-triangle"}
**Trap:** **Yesterday’s narrative.** Many reports are written annually. Good for the **direction**, not the day-to-day. Pair with fresher signals (web, interviews).
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal" icon="lightbulb"}
**Mini-Case — The “Skinimalism” Feature Cut**  
A beauty startup planned a 7-step routine.  
Product reports show a “skinimalism” trend — fewer steps, cleaner labels.  
Market outlooks confirm growth in 2-in-1 formats.  
They cut features, improved margins, and matched distribution to retailers pushing simplification.  
**Lesson:** Use product trends to **remove** features, not just add them.
:::

---

### 4. Capital & Competitors  
*“Who funds whom, and how does the money move?”*

Use **capital** data to map investor theses, check round sizes/valuations, and find likely partners.  
Use **competitor** views to understand strategy, hiring, and go-to-market shifts.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="map"}
**Starter map (examples):** Deal databases, investor profiles, M&A trackers, competitive landscapes, hiring trend trackers.  
**Questions it answers:**  

- Who invests in my space, at what stage and check size?  
- What comps do investors use?  
- Where are competitors expanding (hiring, partnerships, acquisitions)?
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal" icon="alert-triangle"}
**Trap:** **Survivorship bias.** Deal lists spotlight winners. Study **near-misses** and exits too, or you’ll overestimate your odds.
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal" icon="lightbulb"}
**Mini-Case — The Strategic Angel Map**  
A B2B founder needs smart seed investors.  
Deal data reveals 12 angels who repeatedly back vertical SaaS with distribution via channel partners.  
They target those 12 with a pitch that mirrors the pattern.  
**Lesson:** Use capital maps to **aim** your raise — and to shape your go-to-market to match proven paths.

## Starter Sources for Private Data

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="map"}
Private data comes in flavors. Each side of the table has its go-to databases — here are a few you can try at BYU’s library (details in the **Evidence Toolkit**):

- **Industry & Finance** → *BizMiner, Mergent Key Business Ratios*  
- **Competitors & Deals** → *PitchBook, PrivCo, Capital IQ*  
- **Markets & Products** → *IBISWorld, Euromonitor, Mintel*  
- **Consumers & Behavior** → *Simmons, Social Explorer, Statista*  

**Pro Tip:** Don’t try to read them all. Grab one per side, enough to see the range. Your goal is **bounds**, not false precision.  
:::

## Common Pitfalls (and Fixes)

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal" icon="alert-triangle"}
**Pitfall:** **License & “educational use only.”**  
**Fix:** Check usage terms before exporting, sharing, or using outside class. Summarize insights; don’t redistribute proprietary PDFs.
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal" icon="alert-triangle"}
**Pitfall:** **Apples vs. oranges.** Different sources define markets differently.  
**Fix:** Read the fine print: geographies, NAICS/SIC, channel scope, time window. Align definitions before comparing.
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal" icon="alert-triangle"}
**Pitfall:** **Copy-paste charts as “proof.”**  
**Fix:** Convert to decisions: ratios → unit economics; market size → beachhead; deal comps → target raise & milestones.

## Toolkit Boosts for Private Data

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="check-circle"}
**Boost:** **Decision-first search**  
Start with the decision (“choose price tier”, “pick channel”, “target investor”), then pull **just enough** private data to move. Avoid the rabbit hole.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="check-circle"}
**Boost:** **Triangulate**  
Pair one **deep** paid source with one **fresh** public/web signal and one **own** observation (pilot, interview, small test).
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="check-circle"}
**Boost:** **Localize & unitize**  
Translate national averages into **per-store / per-rep / per-subscriber** metrics in **your** city and **your** channel.

## Entrepreneur’s Checklist: Using Private Data

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="tools"}
1. [ ] **Frame the decision.** What choice will this data change?  
2. [ ] **Pick the pair.** Industry & Finance, Consumer & Behavior, Product & Market, or Capital & Competitors.  
3. [ ] **Grab one source per side.** Enough to get *ranges*, not false precision.  
4. [ ] **Note license limits.** Educational vs. commercial use; cite responsibly.  
5. [ ] **Translate to action.** A price, a channel bet, a feature cut, an investor list.  
6. [ ] **Log assumptions.** What would make you revisit this conclusion?
