# How to Gather Evidence

## The Real Risk
Most entrepreneurs don’t fail for lack of ideas — they fail for lack of reliable evidence.  
Evidence isn’t just something you stumble on; it’s something you *gather with care*.  

## The Scientist’s Lens
You don’t need a lab coat, but you do need a method.  
Like a scientist, you:  

1. Form a question.  
2. Gather evidence.  
3. Interpret what it means.  
4. Act — then repeat.  

This isn’t about perfection. It’s about clarity strong enough to make the call.  

## Core Principles of Gathering

### Entrepreneur’s Toolkit: Gathering Principles

- **Ask before you measure** — let the question drive the data.  
- **Triangulate** — cross-check with at least two sources.
- **Stay lean** — don’t spend more than the decision is worth.  
- **Spot traps early** — bias, vanity metrics, and false certainty.  
- **Stop in time** — gather until you can act, then act.

## Avoiding Traps

### Bias
Bias creeps in when you ask the wrong people or the wrong questions.  
If you only talk to friends, they’ll encourage you. If you ask, *“Would you buy this?”* many people will nod politely.  
Neither gives you evidence about real behavior.  
To avoid bias, recruit people who actually match your target market and ask about what they’ve already done, not what they might do.  

For example: *asking “Would you buy this?” (leading) instead of “Tell me about the last time you solved this problem” (neutral).*

### Vanity Metrics
Vanity metrics look impressive but don’t drive decisions.  
Likes, page views, or survey responses feel like progress, but they don’t pay the bills.  
Ten thousand likes on Instagram might mean nothing if no one is willing to buy.  
The only metrics that matter are those connected to real behavior: signups, repeat use, or actual dollars spent.

For example: *10,000 Instagram likes ≠ 100 paying customers.*

### False Certainty
False certainty happens when you treat one shiny dataset or expert opinion as the final word.  
A government report, a consultant’s advice, or a single survey can all be useful — but they’re still just one perspective.  
If you stop questioning, you risk building on shaky ground.  
Better to treat any single source as a clue and cross-check it against at least one other signal before making the call.  

For example: *one expert’s opinion is a clue, not a conclusion.*

### Overpaying for Actual Certainty 
It’s tempting to keep gathering evidence until every doubt disappears.  
But every test costs time and money — and not every decision is worth that investment.  

Smart entrepreneurs ask:  

- *How much will this evidence change my decision?*  
- *Is the learning worth the cost and delay?*  

Sometimes the best move is to act with partial clarity, rather than paying too much for “perfect” answers.

## Mini-Case
Two entrepreneurs launched food delivery apps.  

- The first surveyed ten friends and rushed to build, convinced by their enthusiasm.  
- The second scraped delivery times and order volumes from public data, then ran a quick pilot with 20 random households.  

The first app died in six months. The second grew citywide. Same idea. Different gathering.  

## Closing
Gathering isn’t about finding perfect answers.  
It’s about having enough information to process to move forward with eyes open.  
Think of yourself as a scientist in the marketplace: observing, testing, and interpreting just enough to act.
