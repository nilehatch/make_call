# How We Know {#sec-how-we-know}

> We don’t have one way of knowing. We have a **toolkit**. The skill is choosing the right tool for the right uncertainty.

Entrepreneurs constantly face the question: *How do you know?*  
Is that advisor’s tip knowledge, or just bias?  
Is the spreadsheet truth, or an illusion built on shaky assumptions?  
Is your conviction evidence, or adrenaline?  


> *It is good to know. But it is better to know that you know.*\
> — Chauncey Riddle

This chapter lays out the major ways humans "know" — and how each can help (or hurt) an entrepreneur in the fog.


## Authority
*Trusting what others claim to know.*  

Authority says we know something because someone else tells us it’s true — and we trust them.  
It’s the epistemology of testimony, teaching, and expert advice.  

**Definition**: Knowledge is accepted when it comes from a trusted authority or source.  

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Use when**:\

- You need quick guidance from someone with deep experience.  
- You’re outside your expertise and can’t verify everything yourself.  

**Watch for**:\

- Mistaking *confidence* for *competence*.  
- Biases in the authority’s own experience (their past may not match your context).  
- Devices that *look* like authority (titles, jargon, past triumphs, displayed wealth, swagger) but don’t prove actual expertise.  

**In practice**:\

- Check whether the authority’s claims are backed by evidence you can also access.  
- Compare multiple trusted voices, not just one.  
- Use authority as a starting point, not the final word.
:::

Authority is efficient. It lets you skip the slow grind of figuring everything out yourself.
But it’s also fragile: advice that was right for someone else’s market or moment can steer you wrong in yours.
Treat authority as borrowed confidence, not final truth. It can guide you, but only evidence from your own market can confirm what’s true *for you*.  

::: {.callout-tip icon = "false" title = "Mini Case: The Mentor’s Trap"}
A founder sets her subscription price at \$20/month because a high-profile mentor insists that’s the "sweet spot."  
She launches — and nobody bites. When she finally talks to her own customers, she learns they’d pay \$8–10 but feel \$20 is absurd.

The mentor’s confidence wasn’t malicious; it just came from another context.  
:::

*Authority gives speed, not certainty.*


## Rationalism
*Conclusions from premises with logic.*

Rationalism says we know something when it follows logically from premises we already accept.  
It’s the epistemology of math proofs, syllogisms, and balance sheets.  

**Definition:** Knowledge is justified when it can be deduced logically from accepted premises.  

In entrepreneurship, rationalism shows up in spreadsheets, models, and forecasts.  
When you calculate runway, model churn, or prove your unit economics, you’re leaning on rationalism.  

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Use when:** reasoning from clear premises (unit economics, cash flow).  
**Watch for:** wrong premises; logic that hides desire.  
**In practice:** expose your assumptions; contradiction check.  
:::

The strength of rationalism is clarity: if your premises are right, the conclusion follows.  
But its weakness is obvious too: logic can’t fix bad inputs.  
The fix is to pair rationalism with empiricism — test your premises against actual observations before trusting the elegance of the math.

::: {.callout-tip icon = "false" title = "Mini-case: The Runway Mirage"}
A founder builds a 12-month runway projection. Every formula checks out, every cell ties neatly.  
But hidden in the model is one untested assumption: "We’ll sell 1,000 units a month starting in May."  
When May comes and sales stall at 200, the runway evaporates.  

The math was flawless. The premise was fantasy.  
:::

*Logic sharpens assumptions, it doesn’t prove them.*


## Empiricism {#sec-empiricism}
*Let observation — especially behavior — speak.*  

Empiricism says we know something by observing it with our senses — seeing, hearing, touching, testing.  
It’s the epistemology of looking, measuring, and trying things out.  

**Definition:** Knowledge is justified when it comes from direct observation or experience.  

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Use when:** direct behaviors or outcomes are visible (lines, clicks, sales).  
**Watch for:** misleading appearances; things you can’t sense (future, causation).  
**In practice:** treat observations as signals — but probe deeper before betting everything.  
:::

Entrepreneurs lean on empiricism when they shadow customers, watch store traffic, or track clicks in real time.  
It gives crisp, undeniable facts — but it doesn’t always explain them.  
The move is to use empiricism as your signal, then turn to other tools — rationalism for logic, pragmatism for results, or science for structure — to dig into the *why*.  

::: {.callout-tip icon = "false" title = "Mini-case: The Busy Café"}
An entrepreneur watches two ice cream shops. One is packed, the other nearly empty.  
She concludes: "The busy shop has better ice cream."  
Later, she learns the crowded café sits across from a university, while the quiet one is tucked in a residential block.  

Her observation was true. Her interpretation wasn’t.  
:::

*Observation shows what is, not why it is.* 


## Pragmatism

*Do what works — even if you don’t yet know why.*  

Pragmatism says we know something because it produces useful results.
It’s the epistemology of tinkering, hacks, and trial-by-fire fixes.

**Definition:** Knowledge is justified when it reliably delivers results, regardless of theory.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Use when**: you need to act fast, or when theory/data are incomplete.\
**Watch for**: short-term wins that mask long-term costs; mistaking correlation for causation.\
**In practice**: keep what works, but stay curious about why — so you don’t stall at shallow fixes.
:::

Pragmatism is a lifeline in uncertain situations. If offering free shipping spikes sales, you don’t have to solve the psychology of consumer behavior to keep offering it.
But the trap is complacency: settling for "it works" without probing deeper can blind you to better opportunities or hidden risks.

::: {.callout-tip icon = "false" title = "Mini-case: The Free Shipping Fix"}
A small e-commerce founder notices sales double the week she offers free shipping.
She makes it permanent. Revenue grows — but margins shrink, and costs quietly erode her profit.
It worked in the short run, but without asking why, she missed the chance to adjust pricing or operations to keep it sustainable.
:::

*Pragmatism keeps you moving, but don’t stop digging for the why.*


## Imagination

*Making things up — as a way forward.*

Imagination says we know something by creating a story, model, or hypothesis that fills the gap when evidence is thin.
It’s the epistemology of "what if…?" thinking, storyboards, and napkin sketches.

**Definition:** Knowledge is proposed through invention or hypothesis — creating stories, models, or “what if” scenarios when evidence is missing. (Philosophers sometimes call this abduction or fabrication.)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Use when**: data is scarce, the future is unclear, or you need to explore possibilities.\
**Watch for**: mistaking imagination for reality; falling in love with your own idea.\
**In practice**: treat imagined models as prototypes for thought — things to test, not truths to trust.
:::

Imagination is the entrepreneur’s first leap. Without it, there’s nothing to test, no vision to chase. But imagination without discipline can be dangerous: it produces castles in the sky, beautiful but ungrounded. Don't hold to imagined knowledge to tightly — it generates hypotheses that need empirical or rational follow-up.

::: {.callout-tip icon = "false" title = "Mini-case: The Market That Wasn’t"}
A founder imagines a booming market for smart toasters. She sketches a story: busy parents want fresh bread timed to their mornings.
The story drives her pitch deck, her prototype, even her excitement.
But when she runs actual surveys, she finds almost no one sees toasters as worth upgrading.

Her imagination was vivid. Reality wasn’t.
:::

*Imagination is the spark — but it only matters if you test the fire it lights.*


## Science
*Weaving ways of knowing into a method.*

Science says we know something when multiple ways of knowing are braided together — observation, reasoning, skepticism, imagination, and testing — into a process that can be repeated and checked.
It’s the epistemology of experiments, prototypes, and disciplined iteration.

**Definition:** Knowledge is justified when it comes from a repeatable process — imagining a test, running it, gathering observations, and analyzing results. Science works by weaving other epistemologies into a disciplined method.  

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Use when:** you need reliability, repeatability, and stronger confidence than any single epistemology gives.\
**Watch for:** false certainty ("science says"); treating the process as flawless instead of iterative; experiments designed to prove rather than test.\
**In practice:** treat science as a weave — integrate imagination (for hypotheses), empiricism (for data), rationalism (for analysis), skepticism (for testing), and pragmatism (for application).
:::

Science is not just empiricism with extra steps. It’s a braid of epistemologies: imagination to generate a testable idea, rationalism to structure the logic, empiricism to gather observations, skepticism to challenge assumptions, and pragmatism to apply what works. No single strand is strong enough on its own. Together, they create a rope you can climb.

::: {.callout-tip icon = "false" title = "Mini-case: The Prototype Loop"}
A startup suspects that a new packaging design will boost sales.

- **Imagination**: "Shoppers will grab it if it looks eco-friendly."
- **Rationalism**: Design a clean test — old packaging vs. new packaging.
- **Empiricism**: Run the A/B test in stores and watch the results.
- **Skepticism**: Ask — were sales up because of packaging, or because of a holiday bump?
- **Pragmatism**: If it works, scale it. If not, scrap it.

The loop doesn’t end — each cycle weaves the strands tighter, moving from hunch to evidence to confident knowledge.
:::

*Science is a tool, not a verdict. It won’t erase uncertainty — but it gives you a way to chip at it.*


## Scholarship (Synthesis)
*Building knowledge by studying what others have already discovered.*  

Scholarship says we know something when we gather, interpret, and synthesize existing research, records, and ideas.
It’s the epistemology of books, reports, and prior work — standing on the shoulders of others.

**Definition**: Knowledge is justified when it’s drawn from systematic study and synthesis of existing sources.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Use when**: entering a new field, mapping past patterns, or grounding your ideas in context.\
**Watch for**: outdated sources, cherry-picking, or over-relying on the past in fast-changing markets.\
**In practice**: survey broadly, compare multiple sources, and treat scholarship as foundation — not ceiling.
:::

Scholarship gives entrepreneurs a head start. Instead of rediscovering the wheel, you can build on what’s already known. It helps you see trends, test assumptions against history, and borrow insights from other industries.  
But its weakness is obvious: the past doesn’t always predict the future. Scholarship clarifies the road behind you, not always the one ahead.

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="Mini-case: The Market Report Mirage"}
An entrepreneur digs into market reports on renewable energy.
Every source says "solar is the future." So she builds her plan around solar panels.

But by the time she launches, regulation and subsidies have swung hard toward wind and storage. Her scholarship was thorough — but it locked her into yesterday’s narrative.
:::

*Scholarship keeps you from reinventing the wheel — but don’t mistake old maps for the territory ahead.*


## Skepticism 

*Doubt as a way to test what counts as knowing.*

Skepticism says we know less than we think we do — and that every claim deserves scrutiny.
It’s the epistemology of questioning, probing, and refusing to take things at face value.

**Definition**: Knowledge is justified only when it survives critical doubt and testing against contrary evidence.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Use when**: stakes are high, signals are noisy, or claims sound too good to be true.\
**Watch for**: cynicism that rejects everything, or paralysis that stops you from ever acting.\
**In practice**: push for disconfirming evidence, ask "what would prove this false?", and balance doubt with timely decisions.
:::

Skepticism is a shield. It protects entrepreneurs from hype, false signals, and the temptation to believe what they hope is true. By pressing on weak spots, it can save you from expensive mistakes.\
Skepticism clears away noise, but it cannot guide you forward alone. Too much doubt can paralyze you, leaving every option unchosen, every opportunity unexplored. Pair doubt with action — trust, test, and decide when enough questions have been asked.

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="Mini-case: The Too-Good Trend"}
A founder hears that blockchain real estate startups are "the next unicorns."
Instead of diving in, she digs deeper: Who’s making the claim? What’s the evidence?
After some digging, she finds most of the hype comes from investors already holding tokens.

Her skepticism saves her from chasing a bubble.
:::

*Skepticism is guardrails, not brakes. It stops* bad *action, but not* all *action.*


## Conviction
<!--*Acting on belief when the evidence is thin.*  -->
*The inner knowing that keeps you moving when evidence is thin.*  

Some call this *faith* — the willingness to move without proof.  
In secular terms, we’ll call it **conviction**: the inner anchor that lets you act even when the data is weak or the models don’t agree.  

**Definition:** Knowledge is accepted when belief is held with such strength that it compels action, even without full justification or evidence.  

Conviction is powerful because entrepreneurship always involves moments when the evidence isn’t enough. If you wait for certainty, you’ll never start. But conviction cuts both ways: it can carry you through storms, or it can blind you to warning signs.  

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Use when:** the evidence is thin but action can’t wait.  
**Watch for:** mistaking stubbornness for conviction.  
**In practice:** keep conviction alive — but tether it to new evidence as it arrives.  
:::

Conviction is not irrational. It is a bet that your belief deserves to be tested in the world. Entrepreneurs often feel this as a deep “I know this matters” even before the data can confirm it. The challenge is to treat conviction as a starting engine, not a permanent autopilot.\
Conviction is the bridge between uncertainty and evidence. It carries you into action when knowledge is incomplete, but it works best when you invite new knowledge in as you go.  

::: {.callout-tip icon = "false" title = "Mini-case: The Mission-Driven Founder"}
An entrepreneur feels certain the world needs a new kind of clean energy device.  
The evidence is thin, the prototypes fragile, the investors hesitant.  
Still, she can’t shake the conviction that this problem matters too much to ignore.  

That conviction sustains her long enough to run the experiments, win early adopters, and slowly gather the proof that others demanded up front.  
:::
*Conviction is fuel, not proof. Let it spark motion — but keep testing whether the fire deserves to grow.*


## Mini-case: Which Tool First?

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
An advisor says, *"Raise your price."*  
Your spreadsheet says, *"Fix churn."*  
Customers say, *"We love it."*  
Usage is flat.  
Inside, you feel called to serve this market.  

Which tool do you reach for first? Which backup tool? What’s your next test?
:::


## Try This: Epistemology Audit

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Pick one belief about your venture. Run it through the toolkit:

1. **Authority:** Who told you? What’s their exact claim?  
2. **Logic** (rationalism): What premises are you assuming?  
3. **Observation** (empiricism): What have you actually seen customers do?  
4. **Pragmatism:** What’s working now?  
5. **Imagination:** What story are you imagining?  
6. **Science:** What’s your next structured test?  
7. **Skepticism:** What’s your threshold for changing your mind?  
8. **Conviction:** What conviction keeps you moving even if the data shifts?  

Write down one **next test** and one **stop condition**.
