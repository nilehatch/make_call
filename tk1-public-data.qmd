# E1. Public Data Toolkit {#sec-public-data-toolkit-chapter .unnumbered}

Public data isn’t one big pile — it’s more like a set of doorways into different parts of the market. To keep things simple, we’ve grouped the most useful sources into six categories. Each one gives you a different kind of visibility:  

1. **Market Size & Demographics** – Who and where the people are. Population counts, income levels, and regional growth.\
    *Census, Stats America, World Bank, OECD*

2. **Consumer Trends & Behavior** – How people live, spend, and change over time. Search interest, opinions, habits, and confidence.\
    *Google Trends, Pew Research, American Time Use Survey, Consumer Expenditure Surveys*

3. **Industry & Employment** – What work gets done and how much it pays. Jobs, wages, and sector trends.\
    *Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic Census, Business Trends Outlook*

4. **Global & Comparative** – How one country or region stacks up against another. Health, wealth, trade, and development indicators.\
    *Gapminder, Our World in Data, UN/IMF datasets*

5. **Open Data Platforms** – General-purpose portals and repositories where you can explore or download datasets directly.\
    *Kaggle, local open-data portals, Statista (limited free)*
    
6. **Specialty & Applied Sources** – Niche tools and guides for specific needs, from government contracting to advertising rules.\
    *SBA Market Research tools, FTC advertising basics, Country Commercial Guides*

Think of these as **six lenses**. No single one is enough on its own, but together they give you a fuller radar screen of markets, customers, and competition.  

## 1. Market Size & Demographics {#sec-market-size}

Before you design a product, you need to know the lay of the land: how many people there are, where they live, how much they earn, and how their economies are changing. This isn’t guesswork — public data gives you a map of the population and its potential.  

Each of these sources offers a different lens on markets and people:  

- **Population & business basics (U.S. Census Bureau)** give local snapshots of demographics, income, and business activity.  
- **Regional profiles (Stats America)** highlight clusters, growth patterns, and workforce composition at the state and city level.  
- **Global indicators (World Bank Open Data)** track GDP, trade, and development trends across countries.  
- **Cross-country comparisons (OECD)** provide benchmarks to see how one economy stacks up against another.  

Used together, these datasets help entrepreneurs answer questions like: *Is this city big enough for our idea? Which regions are growing fastest? Where does this country fit in the global picture?*  


### U.S. Census Bureau  
[Visit Census.gov](https://www.census.gov)  

**Good For:** Population, age, income, business patterns  
**Not Great For:** Real-time trends (data lags months or years)  

#### Fast Track:
1. Go to [QuickFacts](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts).  
2. Type in your city, county, or state.  
3. Compare population growth, income, and business counts.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case:
A food truck owner pulled QuickFacts for three neighborhoods. One had 20% more residents aged 20–34 with higher-than-average income. She parked there — and sold out daily.

#### Pro Tip: 
Don’t stop at averages. Use tools like Census Business Builder to see *which neighborhoods actually match your customer profile.*

---

### Stats America  
[Visit Stats America](https://www.statsamerica.org/Default.aspx)  

**Good For:** Regional economic indicators, industry clusters, workforce stats, demographic insights.  
**Not Great For:** Real-time market shifts or consumer-level behavior.  

#### Fast Track
1. Go to **Industry Clusters** or **Innovation Index 2.0** for regional trends.  
2. Use the **Big Radius Tool** to pull demographic and workforce stats around a location.  
3. Export a table or report for quick reference.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A furniture maker scouting a second plant used the Industry Cluster tool. One county showed twice as many wood suppliers within 50 miles. Lower transport costs tipped the decision.

#### Pro Tip
Best for smaller regions. Use it when national data feels too broad — counties and metros often hide the real growth story.

---

### World Bank Open Data  
[Visit World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org)  

**Good For:** Global economic indicators, trade, business environment, and development data.  
**Not Great For:** Hyper-local or real-time insights (data is often annual and broad).  

#### Fast Track
1. Go to [Country Profiles](https://data.worldbank.org/country) for GDP, inflation, and trade at a glance.  
2. Browse the [Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/getting-started) for detailed indicators by region or sector.  
3. Download charts or CSVs directly for quick comparisons.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A telemedicine startup eyeing Southeast Asia compared GDP growth and healthcare spending. Vietnam’s numbers were rising faster than neighbors’ — so they made it their beachhead market.

#### Pro Tip
Pair with fresher signals like Google Trends or news. It’s a great *scale map*, but not a live radar. 

--- 

### OECD Data  
[Visit OECD Data](https://data.oecd.org)  

**Good For:** Cross-country comparisons on economic performance, education, health, taxation, and social indicators.  
**Not Great For:** Non-member countries (focuses mostly on OECD’s 38 member states, usually wealthier economies).  

#### Fast Track
1. Visit [OECD Data](https://data.oecd.org) and search for a theme in the search bar (e.g., health, jobs, innovation).
2. Use the interactive charts to compare countries side by side.  
3. Download CSVs for deeper analysis or export graphs for quick visuals.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
An ed-tech founder noticed Poland’s high school enrollment was rising, but digital classroom adoption lagged behind. That mismatch signaled demand for education software.

#### Pro Tip
Use OECD for benchmarking wealthy economies. For broader coverage, cross-check with World Bank or UN data.

## 2. Consumer Trends & Behavior

If you want to understand customers, don’t just ask them what they like — watch what they search, how they talk, where their hours go, what they buy, and how confident they feel about the future.  

Each of these lenses shows a different side of consumer reality:  

- **Search interest (Google Trends)** reveals what’s catching attention right now.  
- **Public opinion (Pew Research)** shows what people say they value or worry about.  
- **Time-use patterns (American Time Use Survey)** highlight how daily life actually unfolds.  
- **Spending data (Consumer Expenditure Survey)** tracks where the dollars flow.  
- **Confidence indexes (Surveys of Consumers)** measure whether households feel ready to spend or likely to hold back.  

Taken together, these signals help entrepreneurs move beyond gut instinct to a fuller picture of demand. None is perfect on its own — but triangulated, they make the fog of consumer behavior a lot clearer.  


### Google Trends  
[Visit Google Trends](https://trends.google.com)  

**Good For:** Real-time search interest, seasonality, and spotting rising topics.  
**Not Great For:** Market size (it shows relative interest, not actual numbers of people).  

#### Fast Track
1. Type a search term and select region + time frame.  
2. Compare up to 5 terms to see which gets more attention.  
3. Check **Related Queries** for breakout topics and shifts in language.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
An Etsy seller compared “sustainable fashion” vs. “eco-friendly fashion.” “Sustainable” searches were climbing twice as fast. She switched her product tags — and shop views spiked the next week.

#### Pro Tip
Test multiple phrasings. Customers may be searching with *different words* than the ones you’d expect.

---

### Pew Research Center  
[Visit Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org)  

**Good For:** Public opinion, demographic differences, and how social attitudes shape adoption.  
**Not Great For:** Timely market shifts (reports are rigorous but often lag months or years).  

#### Fast Track
1. Browse by **Topic** (e.g., tech, religion, politics, work).  
2. Use **Demographic filters** (age, gender, income, education) to see subgroup differences.  
3. Pull charts and tables directly for presentations or pitch decks.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A fintech founder saw Pew data showing low-income households were more likely “mobile-only” internet users. That insight drove him to launch a mobile-first loan app instead of a desktop site.

#### Pro Tip
Segment, don’t generalize. Pew is best for spotting *differences between groups*, not headline numbers alone.

--- 

### American Time Use Survey  
[Visit ATUS](https://www.bls.gov/tus/)  

**Good For:** Understanding how different groups actually spend their hours — work, chores, leisure, caregiving.  
**Not Great For:** Real-time trends (data is collected annually and released with a lag).  

#### Fast Track
1. Open **ATUS Data Tables** for breakdowns by activity.  
2. Filter by demographics (age, job type, gender, etc.).  
3. Use **Charts** for a quick visualization of shifts in time use.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A meal-prep startup checked ATUS and saw working parents spend under 30 minutes cooking on weekdays. They marketed 15-minute dinners — a sharper fit than generic “healthy meals.”

#### Pro Tip
Look for gaps between what people say and how they *actually spend their time*. Those mismatches are business opportunities.  

---

### Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CES)  
[Visit CES](https://www.bls.gov/cex/)  

**Good For:** Detailed data on what U.S. households actually spend — food, housing, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and more.  
**Not Great For:** Rapid shifts or niche markets; data is annual and focuses on broad categories.  

#### Fast Track
1. Go to **Tables and Publications** for summary reports.  
2. Open **Expenditure Tables** to see breakdowns by income group, age, or region.  
3. Use the **Interactive Tool** for custom views of spending patterns.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A pet hotel entrepreneur saw CES data showing higher-income households spend twice as much on pet services. She opened in affluent suburbs — and booked out months ahead.

#### Pro Tip
Compare spending categories with your idea. Shrinking categories = headwinds; growing ones = tailwinds. 

---

### Surveys of Consumers (University of Michigan)  
[Visit Surveys of Consumers](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/)  

**Good For:** Gauging consumer confidence, expectations about the economy, and attitudes toward spending.  
**Not Great For:** Detailed demographics or product-level insights — this is about *sentiment*, not specifics.  

#### Fast Track
1. Check the **Consumer Sentiment Index** for the headline confidence number.  
2. Explore historical trends to see how sentiment rises or falls with economic shifts.  
3. Use category reports (e.g., personal finances, business conditions) for nuance.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A toy store owner noticed consumer sentiment dipped before Christmas. Instead of overstocking toys, she doubled down on essentials — avoiding unsold inventory that sank competitors.

#### Pro Tip
Check both *current conditions* and *future expectations*. Optimism about tomorrow can be as valuable as confidence today.

<!-- 
#### Pro Tip  
Don’t just look at the headline number. Dig into the **expectations vs. current conditions** split. If consumers feel bad about the present but optimistic about the future, demand may rebound — and you can position yourself ahead of the curve.

## 3. Industry & Employment

Behind every customer market is a workforce and the industries that employ them. If you’re starting a business, you need to know what jobs exist, what they pay, how industries are structured, and how confident businesses are feeling.  

Three key sources cover different time horizons:  

- **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** — wages, employment, and productivity.  
- **Economic Census** — the five-year deep dive into industry size, revenue, and structure.  
- **Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS)** — near real-time signals on business conditions and confidence.  

Together, they help entrepreneurs answer questions like: *Where can I hire the skills I need? How competitive is this industry? What shocks or shifts are happening right now?*  

### Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  
[Visit BLS.gov](https://www.bls.gov)  

**Good For:** Jobs, wages, productivity, consumer spending, and industry trends.  
**Not Great For:** Customer preferences or real-time market demand (data often lags).  

#### Fast Track
1. Visit the [Economy at a Glance](https://www.bls.gov/eag/) page for quick snapshots of industries and regions.  
2. Use the **Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics** tool to check average wages by role and location.  
3. Browse **Databases, Tables & Calculators by Subject** for deeper dives into productivity, inflation, or industry-specific stats.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A café owner checked BLS wage data for cooks in her metro. Knowing the median pay helped her set competitive wages without overspending.

#### Pro Tip
Use Economy at a Glance for quick location comparisons. It’s the fastest way to see how states or metros differ.

---

### Economic Census  
[Visit the Economic Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census.html)  

**Good For:** The most comprehensive snapshot of U.S. industries — revenues, expenses, number of firms, and business patterns down to detailed sectors and geographies.  
**Not Great For:** Timeliness; it’s collected every five years, so it lags behind current conditions.  

#### Fast Track
1. Visit the [Economic Census page](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census.html)  on census.gov.  
2. Use the **Data Tables** to explore industry-by-industry breakdowns.  
3. Check **geographic profiles** to see how industries vary by state, county, or metro area.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A cleaning franchise compared revenue per firm across metro areas. Suburbs had fewer firms but higher average revenue — pointing to less crowded, more profitable markets.

#### Pro Tip
Think of it as the *industry blueprint* — use it for structure and size, then layer on faster-moving sources.

---

### Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS)  
[Visit BTOS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/btos.html)  

**Good For:** Near real-time insights into how U.S. businesses are doing — sales, supply chains, hiring, and confidence.  
**Not Great For:** Long-term planning; data is high-frequency but not as deep or detailed as the Economic Census.  

#### Fast Track
1. Go to the [BTOS program page](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/btos.html).  
2. Browse headline indicators for business conditions and supply chain health.  
3. Filter by sector to see how industries differ.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A small manufacturer saw BTOS data showing rising supply chain delays in their sector. They pivoted to local suppliers — avoiding the shortages competitors faced.

#### Pro Tip
It’s a pulse check, not a blueprint. Use BTOS for *timely shifts*, then confirm with deeper sources.

## 4. Global & Comparative  

Sometimes the question isn’t just *what’s happening here* but *how does here compare to there*. Global data sources let you benchmark across countries and regions — from health and wealth to education and trade.  

- **Gapminder** makes big-picture global trends easy to see through interactive visuals.  
- **Our World in Data** provides clean datasets and charts on everything from energy to health outcomes.  
- **UN, IMF, and related datasets** supply official international indicators for economics, development, and finance.  

Use these when you’re exploring international expansion, comparing regions, or looking for broad global signals.  

### Gapminder  
[Visit Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/)  

**Good For:** Visualizing global trends in income, health, education, and population over time.  
**Not Great For:** Fine-grained or up-to-the-minute data; it’s designed for clarity and teaching, not for industry-specific detail.  

#### Fast Track
1. Go to **Gapminder Tools** and pick indicators (e.g., income, life expectancy).  
2. Adjust regions or countries to compare side by side.  
3. Watch how the bubbles shift over time to see long-term trends.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A health-tech startup used Gapminder to compare diabetes rates and income levels. They spotted rising middle-income countries where chronic disease was accelerating — a future demand signal.

#### Pro Tip 
Use it as a *trend spotter*. Once you see where the world is heading, dive deeper with more specific data.

---

### Our World in Data  
[Visit Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)  

**Good For:** Clean, research-backed datasets and charts on global issues — energy, environment, health, poverty, technology adoption, and more.  
**Not Great For:** Local or micro-level data; it’s focused on big-picture global questions.  

#### Fast Track
1. Search for your topic (e.g., renewable energy, internet adoption).  
2. Explore the interactive charts with built-in download options.  
3. Use the “Data” tab to export underlying numbers if you need your own analysis.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A solar appliance startup saw OWID charts showing electricity access growing but still unreliable in rural Africa. That insight pushed them to develop backup-powered solutions.

#### Pro Tip 
Treat it as a *big-picture briefing book* — perfect for pitch decks and framing the global context.

---

### UN & IMF Datasets  
[UN Data](http://data.un.org/) | [IMF Data](https://www.imf.org/en/Data)  

**Good For:** Official international indicators on economics, trade, finance, development, and population.  
**Not Great For:** Easy browsing — the interfaces can feel technical and heavy for first-time users.  

#### Fast Track
1. On **UN Data**, search for country profiles to get population, health, and economic basics.  
2. On **IMF Data**, explore reports like the *World Economic Outlook* for forecasts.  
3. Download tables or reports to compare across multiple countries.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A fintech startup narrowed six possible Latin American markets to two by checking IMF forecasts for GDP stability and low inflation. The data gave them confidence to choose.

#### Pro Tip 
Use these when *credibility matters* — investor decks and international partners trust these sources.

## 5. Open Data Platforms  

Not all data comes from government or research institutions. Increasingly, it’s gathered and shared on open platforms. These are treasure troves of raw material, ready to be explored or downloaded.  

- **Kaggle** hosts community-uploaded datasets on everything from e-commerce to sports.  
- **Local open-data portals** (often run by city or state governments) publish things like health inspections, zoning data, or business licenses.  
- **Statista (limited free version)** aggregates charts and data across industries and geographies.  

These platforms are great for quick exploration or for finding datasets you can plug directly into analysis tools.  

### Kaggle Datasets  
[Visit Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  

**Good For:** A huge variety of free, community-uploaded datasets — from retail transactions to sports stats. Great for practice or testing ideas quickly.  
**Not Great For:** Official, verified statistics; quality varies since anyone can upload.  

#### Fast Track
1. Go to Kaggle’s **Datasets** section and search by keyword (e.g., “soda sales” or “cryptocurrency”).  
2. Preview the dataset size and description before downloading.  
3. Use the built-in tools or export to Excel/R for your own analysis.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A founder building a résumé-scoring app downloaded a Kaggle dataset of job postings. It let him test which skills employers valued most — without gathering data himself.

#### Pro Tip
Treat it as a sandbox. Great for testing ideas, but always *cross-check before betting big*.

---

### Local Open-Data Portals  
[Explore U.S. Cities](https://www.opendatanetwork.com)  

**Good For:** City- or state-level datasets like business licenses, restaurant inspections, transit data, zoning, or crime statistics.  
**Not Great For:** Broad national or global comparisons — coverage depends on whether your city/state maintains a portal.  

#### Fast Track
1. Search “open data” + your city or state (e.g., “Chicago open data portal”).  
2. Browse by category (business, health, transportation).  
3. Download datasets directly as CSV or use interactive dashboards.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A food truck owner pulled her city’s restaurant closure data. One district had heavy demand but lots of recent closures. She set up there — and found eager customers with little competition.

#### Pro Tip 
Perfect for hyper-local ventures. The nuggets here often don’t exist in national datasets.

---

### Statista (Limited Free Version)  
[Visit Statista](https://www.statista.com)  

**Good For:** Quick, visual snapshots of industry stats, market forecasts, and consumer data.  
**Not Great For:** Free depth — most detailed reports require a subscription.  

#### Fast Track
1. Use the search bar for your industry or topic.  
2. Explore free charts (look for the “download” option).  
3. Note the cited source at the bottom — you can often find the original data for free.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A startup pitching investors grabbed a Statista chart on e-commerce growth. Tracing the citation, they found the original OECD dataset — free and with more detail.

#### Pro Tip
Always trace the citation. Statista charts are presentation-ready, but the *original source is often free*.

## 6. Specialty & Applied Sources  

Some questions don’t need broad statistics — they need practical, applied answers. Specialty sources give you guides, rules, and niche datasets designed for entrepreneurs.  

- **SBA Market Research and Competitive Analysis tools** walk you through planning and industry insights.  
- **FTC Advertising & Marketing Basics** outline the legal do’s and don’ts for promotions.  
- **Country Commercial Guides** provide detailed reports on regulations, risks, and opportunities in specific countries.  

These aren’t massive datasets — they’re targeted resources that save you time and help you avoid costly mistakes.  


### SBA Market Research & Competitive Analysis  
[Visit SBA Market Research](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/market-research-competitive-analysis)  

**Good For:** Step-by-step guidance on how to size markets, identify competitors, and build a research plan.  
**Not Great For:** Raw data — it’s a guide, not a dataset.  

#### Fast Track
1. Go to the SBA Market Research page.  
2. Explore the **Market Research & Competitive Analysis** guide.  
3. Use their templates and tools to structure your own market study.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A first-time founder used the SBA’s competitor template to map coffee shops before pitching a bank loan. The structured plan boosted her credibility with lenders.

#### Pro Tip
Use SBA templates to structure your plan. Even if you add more data later, the framework builds credibility.

---

### FTC Advertising & Marketing Basics  
[Visit FTC Advertising and Marketing Basics](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/advertising-marketing/advertising-marketing-basics)

**Good For:** Understanding the legal ground rules for marketing — endorsements, online ads, email campaigns, and truth-in-advertising.  
**Not Great For:** Market sizing or strategy; this is about compliance, not customers.  

#### Fast Track
1. Visit the FTC Advertising & Marketing Basics page.  
2. Review sections relevant to your channel (e.g., social media, email).  
3. Check the guides on endorsements and disclosures before launching a campaign.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A wellness startup reviewed FTC guidelines before posting testimonials. They rewrote claims to avoid misleading health promises — sidestepping a costly cease-and-desist.

#### Pro Tip
Think of this as your *legal safety net*. A quick check here can save you a costly violation.

---

### Country Commercial Guides  
[Visit Country Commercial Guides](https://www.trade.gov/ccg-landing-page)  

**Good For:** Detailed country-by-country reports on business environments, regulations, risks, and opportunities.  
**Not Great For:** Quick, high-level snapshots; these guides are thorough and sometimes dense.  

#### Fast Track
1. Go to the Country Commercial Guides page.  
2. Select the country you’re interested in.  
3. Skim the sections on market conditions, barriers, and entry strategies.  

#### Entrepreneur’s Use Case
A software startup checked Vietnam’s Commercial Guide. Strict data storage laws surfaced early, shaping their localization plans before costly mistakes.

#### Pro Tip
Read these *before* committing to international expansion. They flag risks you won’t catch from stats alone.

## A Final Word  

This Toolkit isn’t meant to be read straight through. Dip in when you need it. Pair what you find here with fresher signals (like interviews or Google Trends). And always ask: *Is this evidence worth the cost of knowing?*  

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal" icon="alert-triangle"}
### Trap to Avoid: Free Doesn’t Mean Easy  

Public data may be free, but it isn’t always simple. Datasets can be outdated, messy, or misleading if taken at face value. Always check the date, scope, and definitions before using them to guide decisions.
