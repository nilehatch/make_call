# Wrapping Up

## Knowing and Deciding in Uncertainty 

Uncertainty is the entrepreneur’s native terrain.  
You’ve seen that it’s not the same as risk, and that pretending otherwise only leads to trouble.  

In this part, you built tools for working with that uncertainty:  

- **Uncertainty vs. Risk.** You learned to name the difference, so you don’t confuse probabilities with unknowns.  
- **Knowledge and Epistemologies.** You explored the ways we come to know — from authority to observation to imagination — and how each can serve or mislead you.  
- **Judgment.** You practiced weighing what you know, what you believe, and when to act.  
- **Belief Revision.** You learned to update within a frame (Bayesian updating) and revise the frame itself when reality no longer fits.

The point isn’t to eliminate uncertainty — you can’t.  
The point is to **navigate it with clarity and confidence**, making calls with eyes open instead of guessing in the fog.  


## Looking Ahead  

Part II shifts from *how to know* toward *how to ask*.  
Once you accept uncertainty and learn to manage your beliefs, the next move is to frame the **right questions**:  

- What don’t I know yet?  
- Which unknowns matter most right now?  
- How do I turn those into testable hypotheses?  

That’s where we go next. Because asking the right questions is what turns uncertainty into insight.
