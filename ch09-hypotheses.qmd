# Hypotheses

Most entrepreneurs make the same mistake: they treat their guesses like facts.  
They “know” customers want their product, “know” the market is huge, and “know” the price is right — until reality proves otherwise.  

The antidote is the humble **hypothesis**.  

## From Guessing to Hypothesizing  

A hypothesis is not just a fancy word for guess.  
It’s a **testable statement** that turns an urgent unknown into something you can check with evidence.  

- A guess says: *“People will love our product.”*
- A hypothesis says: *“At least 30% of gym members offered a sample will purchase one unit at $2.50 within the next week.”*

The difference? A hypothesis can be wrong in a useful way. If the evidence doesn’t support it, you’ve learned something specific and can adjust.  



## Why Hypotheses Matter  

Without hypotheses, entrepreneurs fall into dangerous habits:  

- **Confirmation bias.** Seeing what you want to see in customer reactions.  
- **Vague victories.** Believing “people liked it” means success.  
- **Wasted effort.** Running tests that generate noise instead of insight.  

With hypotheses, your learning becomes sharp. Each test produces a clear signal: supported or not. That clarity saves time, money, and frustration.  


## The Anatomy of a Good Hypothesis  

A strong hypothesis is:  

1. **Focused.** It addresses one urgent unknown, not everything at once.  
2. **Measurable.** It specifies what outcome you’ll look for.  
3. **Time-bound.** It sets a horizon for testing.  
4. **Falsifiable.** It could be proven wrong with real evidence.  


> “If we [*take action*], then [*this measurable result*] will happen within [*timeframe*].”  

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Mini-Case: QuickBite Food Truck"}
QuickBite is a startup run by two friends who want to serve healthy grain bowls from a food truck near office parks.  

They’ve identified several urgent unknowns:  

- Will busy professionals actually choose a grain bowl over faster options like pizza or burgers?  
- Is the $12 price point viable, or will it scare customers away?  
- Are lunchtime crowds large enough to sustain daily sales?  

Instead of treating these as vague worries, QuickBite writes a hypothesis:  

**Hypothesis:**  
*“If we park the truck outside TechHub Plaza for five weekdays, then at least 40 different customers will purchase a grain bowl at $12.”*  
Why is this strong?  

- **Focused:** It’s about one unknown — willingness to buy at $12.  
- **Measurable:** Sales numbers are easy to track.  
- **Time-bound:** One week.  
- **Falsifiable:** If fewer than 40 customers buy, the hypothesis is not supported.  

The test gives them a clear signal: if the hypothesis fails, they may need to adjust price, location, or menu — but either way, they’ll learn something specific instead of guessing.

## Common Pitfalls  

Entrepreneurs often misfire when writing hypotheses. Watch out for:  

- **Too broad.** *“Customers like healthy drinks.”* (Not testable in a week.)  
- **Too vague.** *“People are interested.”* (What does “interested” mean?)  
- **Too certain.** *“Everyone will prefer TechHub Plaza”* (Absolute claims leave no room to learn.)  
- **Unmeasurable outcomes.** *“The brand will gain awareness.”* (How will you measure “awareness”?)  

A good hypothesis doesn’t predict perfection. It creates a learning moment.  



## Abduction: Where Hypotheses Come From  

Not every hypothesis starts with a neat theory.  
Sometimes you just notice something odd — a surprising comment, a pattern in the data, a behavior that doesn’t fit.  

That’s where **abduction** comes in. Abduction is the logic of “best explanation.” It’s how you take a puzzling observation and propose a plausible story that could make sense of it.  

Example: QuickBite’s team noticed that several customers asked if they sold smoothies, even though the truck specialized in grain bowls. That surprise led to an abductive leap:  
*“Maybe what these customers really want isn’t lunch, but quick portable nutrition.”*  

From there, QuickBite could write a hypothesis:  
*“If we add a protein smoothie option for one week, then at least 20% of customers will choose it over the grain bowl.”*  

Abduction doesn’t prove anything. It gives you a starting point — a new angle worth testing.  
Once you’ve made that leap, your hypothesis can enter the cycle of testing, updating, and (if necessary) revising.  


## From Urgent Unknowns to Hypotheses  

Think back to your urgent unknowns. Each one is a question waiting to be reframed.  

#### Profitability
- Urgent Unknown: *“Will customers pay enough to cover costs?”*  
- Hypothesis: *“At least 25% of surveyed target customers will say they would purchase at $12.”*  

#### Channel
- Urgent Unknown: *“Is retail or direct-to-consumer the better channel?”*  
- Hypothesis: *“In a two-week trial, direct sales at gyms will produce at least 3x more unit sales than shelf placement in one convenience store.”*  

## Connecting Hypotheses to Bayesian Updating

Back in @sec-belief-revision-chapter, you learned how to update beliefs the Bayesian way:  

- Start with a prior belief.  
- Gather new evidence.  
- Revise the probability up or down.  

Hypotheses are the missing bridge. They *create* the prior.  
When you write a clear, testable hypothesis, you’re not just making a guess — you’re defining what counts as evidence and how you’ll learn from it.  

That’s why every hypothesis is a launchpad for updating. Without it, you’re just collecting opinions. With it, you’re building knowledge. 

## The Payoff  

Writing hypotheses forces discipline. It moves you from hand-waving to clarity.  
It gives you a specific outcome to check — one that keeps you honest about whether you’re really learning.  

Every urgent unknown deserves a hypothesis. In the next chapter, we’ll explore how to **test them through exploration** — gathering the evidence that shrinks uncertainty and guides your next move.  



## Try This: Write a Proper Hypothesis
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Pick one urgent unknown you identified in the last chapter.  

1. Write it down as a plain question: *“Will customers pay enough to cover costs?”*  
2. Use the template: *“If we [take action], then [this measurable result] will happen within [timeframe].”*  
3. Fill it in. Example: *“If we sell our product in one location for two weeks, then at least 50 unique customers will buy at least one unit.”*
4. Check it against the four tests: Focused, Measurable, Time-bound, Falsifiable.  
5. Revise until it passes all four.  

By the end, you’ll have turned a foggy unknown into a clear hypothesis you can actually test.
