# Exploration {#sec-exploration-chapter}

Sometimes you can’t write a clean hypothesis yet.  
The unknowns are too big, the frame is too fuzzy, or you just don’t know what questions matter most.  

That’s when you need **exploration**.  


## When Hypotheses Aren’t Enough  

Hypotheses are powerful when you already have a frame:  

- You know the domain (customers, pricing, channel).  
- You can define what counts as evidence.  
- You can update beliefs as data rolls in.  

But what if you don’t even know the frame?  

- Which customers to serve?  
- Which problem is real?  
- Which part of the market is worth looking at?  

Exploration comes first.  


## What Exploration Looks Like  

Exploration is structured wandering. Philosopher Ian Hacking [-@hacking2006emergence] described this type of experiment as **adventure** — deliberately stepping into the world, not to confirm what you know, but to experience it and then shape it  by what you discover.

Exploration is how you reduce uncertainty when you can’t yet devise a well-informed hypothesis to run a clean experiment.

Common forms include:  

- **Observation.** Watching how people behave in the wild.  
- **Conversations.** Asking open-ended questions without pitching.  
- **Secondary research.** Digging into existing data, reports, or public sources.  
- **Probes.** Small, low-cost trials that don’t prove much on their own but reveal patterns.  

Exploration doesn’t give you neat answers. It gives you *raw material* — surprises, stories, and signals that point toward what’s really going on.  

For deeper methods and tools for exploration, see the book [*Expeditionary Innovation*](https://ei.nilehatch.com), where you can dive more deeply into [ethnographic exploration techniques](https://ei.nilehatch.com/Explore_Community.html) and [abductive empathy analysis for hypothesizing](https://ei.nilehatch.com/Hypothesize_pain.html) as structured exploration practices.

## Why Exploration Matters  

Entrepreneurs who skip exploration jump straight into testing the wrong things.  
They waste time “validating” a product idea before they’ve validated the problem itself.  

Exploration saves you by:  

- Surfacing customer pains you didn’t know existed.  
- Revealing which groups are actually accessible and worth serving.  
- Exposing flawed assumptions before you sink resources.  


## Connecting Exploration to Belief Revision

Exploration often produces surprises that don’t fit your existing frame.  

- You assumed people wanted faster lunch options, but they kept talking about cheaper ones.  
- You thought small businesses were your market, but enterprise buyers showed more interest.  
- You planned around in-person channels, then a pandemic shut them down.  

These moments call for **belief revision** — not just updating probabilities inside a frame, but rewriting the frame itself.  

Back in @sec-belief-revision-chapter, you learned the rules of revision:

- Expand: Add a new belief when it doesn’t cause contradictions.
- Revise: Add a new belief and adjust old ones so the whole set stays consistent.
- Contract: Drop a belief that no longer fits with the rest.

Exploration is the fuel for revision. It’s how you discover what you didn’t even know you should be asking.  



## How to Explore Well  

1. **Go wide first.** Don’t filter too soon. Look for variety.  
2. **Pay attention to anomalies.** The weird comments or behaviors often matter most.  
3. **Document everything.** Notes, transcripts, photos — don’t trust memory.  
4. **Synthesize.** Step back and look for themes across your observations.  
5. **Leap with abduction.** Use those themes to form new hypotheses worth testing.  

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Mini-Case: FitNest App"}
A student team set out to build **FitNest**, a fitness app for busy parents.  
Their initial idea was clear: parents struggle to find time for long workouts, so the app would deliver short, ten-minute routines to do at home.  

They began with exploration — not pitching, just listening. In early conversations, parents nodded politely about short workouts but quickly shifted the discussion. Again and again, parents talked about *energy crashes in the afternoon* and the stress of *meal planning for the family*.  

This was not what the team expected. Their neat hypothesis about workouts didn’t fit. The anomaly forced them to revise their frame.  

Instead of asking, *“How do we help parents exercise in less time?”* the team reframed the unknown:  
*“Are parents’ real health struggles rooted in nutrition and recovery rather than workouts?”*  

That abductive leap gave them a new path: build a hypothesis around quick, family-friendly meal solutions instead of exercise routines.

## The Payoff  

Exploration isn’t about wandering forever. It’s about wandering *on purpose*.  

It keeps you from locking in too soon, and it gives you the raw insight you need to write hypotheses that matter.  

When you embrace exploration, you stop pretending you know the frame.  
You start discovering it.  


## Try This: Run a Micro-Exploration  
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Pick one group you think might be your customers.  

1. Spend one hour watching or talking to them without pitching.  
2. Write down three things that surprised you.  
3. Turn one surprise into a possible explanation (*abduction*).  
4. Draft a hypothesis you could test next week.  

By the end, you’ll have gone from fog → surprise → abductive leap → testable hypothesis.
