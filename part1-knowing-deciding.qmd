# Part I: Knowing and Deciding in Uncertainty {#sec-knowing-part-1}

Entrepreneurship doesn’t begin with a business plan.  
It begins with *not knowing*.

You don’t know if customers will care.  
You don’t know which features matter.  
You don’t know if timing is with you or against you.  

This fog of uncertainty isn’t a bug in the system — it *is* the system.  
The job of an entrepreneur is not to wait until the fog clears.  
It’s to move forward anyway — learning, adjusting, and deciding as you go.  

In this part of the book, we build the foundation:  

- **Uncertainty** — why it defines entrepreneurship and how it differs from simple risk.  
- **Knowledge** — what it means to “know,” from thin belief to unshakeable knowing.  
- **Epistemology** — the different ways humans claim to know, and how to use that toolkit wisely.  
- **Judgment** — how to act when evidence is incomplete and certainty never comes.  
- **Belief Revision** — how to change your mind when new information reshapes the game itself.  

The goal is not to make you certain. It’s to make you confident enough to act — knowing what you know, learning what you can, and deciding even when you can’t see the whole path ahead.
